# Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The goal is to train a deep learning model to accurately classify images into 10 different classes.

## Project Structure

- `src/`: Contains the source code for the CNN implementation.
  - `cnn_model.py`: Python script defining the CNN architecture.
  - `train.py`: Python script for training the CNN model on the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - `evaluate.py`: Python script for evaluating the trained model on test data.

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploration and analysis.
  - `Data_Exploration.ipynb`: Notebook exploring the CIFAR-10 dataset.
  - `Model_Training.ipynb`: Notebook containing the model training process.

- `data/`: Placeholder for the CIFAR-10 dataset. Use the https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar-10-python.tar.gz dataset

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
